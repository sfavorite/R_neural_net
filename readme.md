## Neural Net

I use this for personal projects when I need to be able to modify/test with the internals of the network. There are much more robust neural networks out there as packages, caret comes to mind. 

The general framework of the software is based on the work of Andrew Ng and the class he taught at Coursera. 


I have tested this software using the Iris and [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits. The Iris dataset comes with R and you can get the MNIST data I used [here](https://github.com/sfavorite/neural_net_hand_written_digits/blob/master/ex4data.RData).
